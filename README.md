# react-aggregator
A sloppily created react link aggregator .

Created using the [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) npm package ([Github docs](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)).

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mteeney01/react-aggregator.git react-aggregator
cd react-aggregator
npm install
cd client 
npm install

# To start server on http://localhost:3001 (this is primarily for a dumb web api while developing)
npm run server

# To start client
cd client && npm run start
# This starts the development server on http://localhost:3000. 
# The dev server is configured to proxy any API requests to :3001.
```
